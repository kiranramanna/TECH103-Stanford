# 3D Solar System Visualization - Local Setup

This is a local implementation of the 3D Solar System visualization project. The implementation includes an interactive 3D model of the solar system with all 8 planets, orbital mechanics, and basic planet information.

## Project Structure

```
007-module2/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file with Three.js implementation
├── js/                 # JavaScript modules
│   └── planet-textures.js  # Module for handling planet textures
├── textures/           # Texture images for planets
│   └── earth.jpg       # Earth texture map
└── readme.md           # Project documentation
```

## Features Implemented

- ✅ 3D visualization of the solar system with the Sun and 8 planets
- ✅ Realistic orbital mechanics with proper inclinations
- ✅ Interactive camera controls (orbit, zoom, pan)
- ✅ Saturn's rings
- ✅ Starfield background
- ✅ Earth texture mapping
- ✅ Interactive planet information on hover
- ✅ Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## Running Locally

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 007-module2
   ```

2. Start a local web server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python (recommended)
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # OR using Node.js
   npx http-server -c-1 .
   ```

3. Open a browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. Interact with the visualization:
   - Click and drag to rotate the view
   - Scroll to zoom in/out
   - Right-click and drag to pan
   - Hover over planets to see their information

## Adding More Planet Textures

To add textures for more planets:

1. Download texture images for the planets you want to enhance
2. Place them in the `textures/` directory
3. Update the `planet-textures.js` file to load and apply these textures

Example for adding a Mars texture:
```javascript
// In js/planet-textures.js
textures.mars = {
  map: textureLoader.load('./textures/mars.jpg')
};

// Then in your main script, apply the texture:
if (name === "Mars" && textureManager.textures.mars) {
  textureManager.applyTextureToPlanet(planet, "mars");
}
```

## Next Steps

- Add normal maps for more realistic terrain
- Implement moons for planets
- Add an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter
- Create a user interface to toggle features and control time speed
- Add educational information about each planet

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with textures not loading:
- Make sure you're accessing the visualization through a web server (not opening the HTML file directly)
- Check browser console for CORS-related errors
- Verify that all file paths are correct relative to the project root
