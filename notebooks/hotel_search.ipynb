       "| review | I really liked this hotel. It‚Äôs location is great - a block of a nice beach access, quiet neighborhood three blocks from the non stop party that is the Art Deco district. Restaurant located downstairs is a great place for drinks, breakfast etc.  What would make me love it was some improvements to the pool area. There are not enough loungers. They have a dry bar that is not staffed, so you have to go downstairs to get drinks poolside. There is couches and tables set up there that art not being utilized. It would make more sense to fill it with more lounge chairs, get rid of the bar, and extend room service to the pool. My 2 cents. |\n",
