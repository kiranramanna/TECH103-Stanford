### Step-by-Step Instructions:

**Step 1: Create Hotel Summaries**  
- Gather and compile detailed information about Miami hotels in data folder.
- Summarize each hotel to include essential attributes such as name, location, amenities, pricing, reviews, etc.
- Create a seperate dataset with these summaries.

**Step 2: Build the Search Functionality**  
- Implement a search feature that retrieves relevant hotels based on user input
- use "def search(query)" function in Lab10a_Semantic_Search_Module.ipynb file
- Test the system: Are the search results relevant to the query? Make adjustments to improve accuracy if needed.

**Step 3 (Bonus): Integrate Internet Search**  
- Use an internet search method as demonstrated in the provided Colab Notebook (Ares_get_started.ipynb).
    - Note: I am using DuckDuckGo search for free version without having to provide API key
- Incorporate real-time data or external sources to enhance the hotel summaries or search results.
