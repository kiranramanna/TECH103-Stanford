I said: Can you check please as I refer to the many tables available!!  She screams no, I don't have this available for 4 people with her 4 fingers and you 2!!  I said we are 3 brother on the way!!  She said and still she screamed: You can have it!  I said why are you angry with us?  She looks at me from top to bottom and turns and leaves us without saying a word!!\\n\\n   Oh my God, I couldn't yell at her because I wouldn't get down to that level with her!!  But in fact this ruined all my stay and we are all still not getting past it!!  Since we didn't do anything, we respectfully asked for another table!\\n\\nDo you think she came back and said sorry i didn\\u2019t mean it ! No !!

I said: Can you check please as I refer to the many tables available!!  She screams no, I don't have this available for 4 people with her 4 fingers and you 2!!  I said we are 3 brother on the way!!  She said and still she screamed: You can have it!  I said why are you angry with us?  She looks at me from top to bottom and turns and leaves us without saying a word!!\\n\\n   Oh my God, I couldn't yell at her because I wouldn't get down to that level with her!!  But in fact this ruined all my stay and we are all still not getting past it!!  Since we didn't do anything, we respectfully asked for another table!\\n\\nDo you think she came back and said sorry i didn\\u2019t mean it ! No !!

everything in his power to avoid seating me in the mostly empty restaurant at 615pm finally he phoned the front desk to verify that i was a hotel guest and ran out of excuses after all that trouble i found the menu limited the food mediocre and the service bordering on surly\\n\\nmy suite was large and nice although there was very low water pressure in the shower and oddly despite mirrors everywhere not one was full length also all of the glasses and coffee mugs in the minibar were dirty\\n\\nso one star for the decent room and for the two people working there who were genuinely nice to me during my 3 days there'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":33}],"source":["# First element of the 'combined'

I really enjoyed having breakfast each morning. There's great options and it's worth the price for both quality and convenience (15 euros). I eat a vegan and gluten free diet, so my options were more limited. The kitchen staff did help me find a few things (oatmeal, granola, cereal, gluten free bread, jams and peanut butter, soy milk, fruit, nuts). I'd like to see potatoes added to the line up.  \\n\\nWe stayed in a superior twin room. The beds are right next to each other, but at least we had our own bedding (I traveled with my mom). There's plenty of room for suitcases (we had two large and one small suitcase) and there's a small closet to hang some clothes and jackets. There was a tub with a shower in our room. The room is very clean, looks new and is cozy. We asked for a quiet room and it was very quiet. We couldn't hear other guests except if people were talking in the hallway. \\n\\nThe hotel staff are very nice and helpful. When I became sick during the trip, I knew the staff would be able to help me find an urgent care facility. I'm so grateful to them for their help. \\n\\nLocation is excellent. 10 min walk to the Louvre. The opera house (which was one of my favorite buildings) is a 10 min walk away. The area around the opera house is very nice...lots of shops and cafes. Also next to the hotel are lots of Asian restaurants which came in handy since I eat a vegan and gluten free diet. I went to a sushi restaurant twice and it was excellent. Place Venome is a beautiful square that is a few minutes walk away. 20 min walk to an excellent vegan restaurant called Le Potager de Charlotte. I highly recommend it. We went there twice. \\n\\nThis is the best hotel I've stayed at ever.

Complimentary bottle of water and I think the bottle of wine might have been complimentary but as we don’t drink alcohol, I didn’t ask. Breakfast was excellent. It was complimentary to us as an upgrade, normal cost was €16-00. Several restaurants nearby. Would recommend for short stay but beware if you have a lot of luggage; there is no room in the room.

I know there are tons of hotel choices in Paris but given the fantastic service, the perfect location and the comfort of the hotel, its hard for my wife and I even considering staying anywhere else. First the hotel. We had room 32, which overlooked Place St Sulpice. If you are going to spend the $ to stay there I'd pay a little more and get the view. Room decent size. Not huge but sufficient for 6 nights. Small sitting area, very comfortable bed, closet. Decent size bathroom/shower. Staff amazing and helpful. From helping with reservations to anything/anywhere, to giving advice to just asking about your day. I had trouble using a web site to get museum tx and one of the staff used his phone, bought the tx and I paid him back. Saved us a lot of time in line. Another time they told us about a web site you had to use in order to get tx to climb up Notre Dame. You do have to pay for breakfast but its elegant, you can sit in an outside patio, and if you are there more than 1 night odds high they will know your coffee preferences by the 2nd morning.Of the 6 days I think we ate there 4x. There are many places nearby if you want something else. Second reason to book is the location- The Luxembourg gardens are right behind you. There are many very good restaurants and bars just across the square. There is a bus stop across the square and a metro nearby. You can easily walk to Notre Dame, D'Orsay, even the Louvre (or a bus drops you off in front). And we are 60+.. We pretty much walked the entire 6th Arrond. Lots of shopping nearby and along St Germain. Despite all of this the area is pretty quiet. You also have a famous church right in front of you and maybe a even more famous one a few blocks over (not counting ND). There is even a grocery store (Marks and Spenser) around the corner.
